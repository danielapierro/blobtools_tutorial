# blobtools_tutorial

A practical guide to blobtools

## what is blobtools?

Blobtools was created by [Laetsch DR and Blaxter ML, 2017.](https://f1000research.com/articles/6-1287/v1) \
The current release is found [here.](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/23453/DRL/blobtools) \
This guide will follow "Workflow A" in the [manual](https://blobtools.readme.io/docs/what-is-blobtools), providing example code at each step.

This workflow applies to *de novo* metagenomes or metatranscriptomes. It allows for taxonomic partitioning without requiring reference genomes.
